ANTHONY JOSHUA MBE FACES FORMER WORLD RULER WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO FOR HIS IBF WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE AND THE VACANT IBO CHAMPIONSHIP AS WELL AS THE WBA SUPER CHAMPIONSHIP ON APRIL 29, 2017 AT WEMBLEY STADIUM CONNECTED BY EE, LIVE ON SKY SPORTS BOX OFFICE.

Anthony Joshua: “This fight will be one of the biggest nights in my boxing career, it marks the highest point of my climb through the professional ranks. It is three years since I turned professional, I have taken the time to gain experience, fight men who have fallen and some who have fought hard and through this I am learning my trade, how the business works and gaining the ring craft which is sometimes underestimated as everyone wants to see the mega fights right away.

It is the perfect time for me to move up another step and contest my heavyweight championship belt against one of the legends of our sport. There is no doubt this will be a titanic battle with a huge amount on the line, just like every fight, but when I enter the ring I will be prepared for victory as I have been with all my other fights. The legend against the champ – it’s time to write history.”

Wladimir Klitschko: “I’m looking forward to this fight of the year, just like boxing fans all around the world. This is the first time in a decade that I’m the challenger again. I will fight against a champion who I consider the best of the young generation. Basically experience will take on youth. This makes this fight that unique. I will be ready for the challenge!”
